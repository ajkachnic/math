# math

the irrelevant piece in the trilogy (sidenote: i think i'm jumping the shark by now)

a blackbox where numbers go to die...

## usage

with typescript:

```typescript
import math from '@ajkachnic/math'
const myNum = 2

console.log(math(myNum, 5)) // how tf knows what it'll do, i certainly don't
```

common js:

```javascript
const math= require('@ajkachnic/math')
const myNum = 2

console.log(math(myNum, 5)) // how tf knows what it'll do
```

## api

two numbers enter but only one can leave...
